## How to run our project
Our project consists of 3 applications. A server application, a desktop application and an android application. Builds of these applications may be found in the Builds folder of this repository<br />
To run our project:
* First run Server.jar. This application was made to run on an AWS instance but may also be run locally.
* Next run Desktop.jar. This application displays the graphics of our project. In the desktop application selecting New Game will connect
to our server application running on an AWS instance. Selecting Local Game will allow you to input the IP address of the Server.jar thats's being run locally.
* Once the desktop application is connected, the android app may be connected. This is connected similarly to the desktop application.
Choose local server on the app and enter the IP address of the machine running Server.jar. Once this is entered, select Join Game to enter the game.
* To begin the game, select Start Game on the Desktop application.
